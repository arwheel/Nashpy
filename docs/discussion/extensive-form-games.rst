Motivating example: A modification of the Coordination Game
-----------------------------------------------------------

Consider the :ref:`Coordination game <motivating-example-coordination-game>`
with the modification that Alice and Bob have more information available to
them: Alice decides where they are going and then lets Bob know before Bob makes
their own choice.

This can be represented pictorially as follows:

Consider the game given by the tree in the following image:

.. admonition:: Question
   :class: note

   Obtain the Normal Form Game representation corresponding to this game and
   find the Nash equilibria.

.. admonition:: Answer
   :class: caution, dropdown


   Well....

Using Nashpy
------------

See :ref:`how-to-use-support-enumeration` for guidance of how to use Nashpy to
use support enumeration to find Nash equilibria once a Normal Form game
representation has been obtained.
